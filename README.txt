This is an implementation of a second-order HMM

How to use:

- Checkout code from github (https://github.com/viettrung/trigram-hmm/)
- Go to directory of folder checkout from github
- We have two options to run this tool, 
   - Run with your sentence  (use main.py)
   - Run with test file (use test.py)

- Wait for result.
- Note: Sentence with new word (not include in Brown Corpus) the result will be wrong --> need care about new word case.
